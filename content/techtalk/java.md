There are three main features in Java 8 that I love, one of them is the lambda expressions, it will have enormous implications for simplifying development. The another one is the new `java.util.stream` package provide a Stream API to support functional-style operations on streams of elements. The Stream API is integrated into the Collections API, which enables bulk operations on collections, such as sequential or parallel map-reduce transformations. And lastly but not least the `java.time` API that now are compatible with lambda, thread safe and simplified usage.
